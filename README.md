## Key Findings

**Scale of Federal Funding**
- **$8.58 trillion** in federal financial assistance distributed (FY2019–2024)
- **Top 10 states** received 50.9% of all federal grants
- **California alone** received $1.05 trillion (12% of total)
- **HHS and USDA** account for 67% of all federal assistance

**What the Audit Data Revealed**
- **57,448 entities** required to submit Single Audits (FY2016–2024)
- **16,300+ entities** had at least one audit finding
- **$1.09 trillion** in funding went to entities with repeat audit findings
- **38,000 SAM-excluded entities** with UEI available for cross-referencing

---

## Why This Exists

Federal funding data is large, fragmented, and hard to interpret quickly. Audit oversight data is even harder because it uses specialized terminology and the impact is not always obvious. Our goal is to make these systems approachable for everyone.

**This project helps users:**
- Explore funding patterns by geography and time
- Learn audit terminology with plain-language definitions
- Follow guided examples (case studies and next steps) to investigate audit data more deeply

## Key Features of AuditsMadeSimple

### 1) Interactive Exploration (Tableau)
Dashboards that highlight:
- Funding distribution across states
- Funding trends over time
- Major funding sources by federal agency
- Higher-risk entities with funding context

### 2) Financial Literacy Glossary
A glossary translating common audit and spending terms into short, usable definitions.

### 3) Dataset Guide
Plain descriptions of USAspending, FAC, and SAM: what each tracks, what each misses, and how to use them responsibly.

### 4) Guided Engagement (Case Studies + What’s Next)
Short walkthroughs and a checklist-style “What’s next?” page that keeps visitors engaged after their first chart.

## Integrated Data Sources

We connect official public sources using **UEI (Unique Entity Identifier)** whenever possible.

| Source | What It Tracks |
|--------|-----------------|
| **USAspending.gov** | Federal spending and award transactions: who received funds, how much, and from which agency |
| **FAC.gov** | Single Audit submissions for non-federal entities expending $750K+ in federal awards |
| **SAM.gov** | Governmentwide exclusions: debarments, suspensions, and other exclusion actions |

**USAspending transformations**

USAspending transaction-level data was transformed into recipient-level summaries for each fiscal year (2019–2024), then combined for cumulative analysis. Outputs were exported to CSV and Tableau Hyper formats for dashboard integration.

![USAspending All Years](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/USAspending_All_Years.png)
![USAspending FY2023](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/USAspending_FY2023.png)
![USAspending FY2024](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/USAspending_FY2024.png)

**FAC Master Clean**

Four FAC tables (General, Findings, Corrective Action Plans, Federal Awards) were joined and aggregated to entity level by `auditee_uei`, producing 57.4K clean audited entity records. Outputs preserve audit flags, finding counts, and federal expenditure amounts for risk scoring and USAspending integration.

![FAC Master Clean](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/FAC%20Master%20Clean.png)

**Audit Health Score construction**

The Audit Health Score was calculated for each entity using weighted risk factors including going concern (25 pts), material weakness (20 pts), repeat findings (15 pts), and significant deficiencies (10 pts), with mitigating factors applied. Entities were tiered into Red, Yellow, and Green categories to support dashboard visualizations and funding analysis.

![FAC Master With Risk Score](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/FAC_Master_With_Risk_Score.png)

**FAC + USAspending Merge**

FAC audit data was joined to USAspending financial assistance records on UEI to link audit findings with federal funding received. This merge enables analysis of how much taxpayer money flowed to entities with material weaknesses, repeat findings, or going concern flags.

![FAC USAspending Merged](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/FAC_USAspending_Merged.png)

**SAM + FAC Merge**

SAM exclusion data was joined to FAC audit records on UEI to identify entities with both exclusion history and audit findings. This cross-reference supports transparency gap analysis of debarred or suspended entities.

![SAM FAC Merged](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/SAM_FAC_Merged.png)

**SAM Exclusion Cleaning**

SAM exclusion records were split by UEI availability (38K with UEI, 120K legacy records without), with date parsing to calculate exclusion duration and active status. Outputs support transparency gap analysis and cross-referencing of excluded entities against federal award recipients.

![SAM Exclusion Cleaning](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/alteryx/SAM_Exclusion_Cleaning.png)

**ML Training Dataset Build**

Consecutive fiscal years were joined on UEI to create a supervised learning dataset, using prior-year audit signals as predictors and next-year finding occurrence as the target variable. This structure enables predictive modeling of future audit risk.

**Funding Distribution & Trends**

These visualizations show where federal financial assistance flows geographically and how funding levels changed over the six-year period. The Top 10 states account for over half of all federal grants, with California alone receiving 12% of the national total.

![Bar - Top 10 States Receive 50.9% of All Federal Grants](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/tableau/Bar%20-%20Top%2010%20States%20Receive%2050.9%25%20of%20All%20Federal%20Grants.png)

**Audit Oversight Signals**

These maps highlight where audit findings are concentrated relative to funding received. Material weakness rates vary significantly by state, revealing geographic patterns in internal control quality.

![Findings Per $1M in Federal Spending by State](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/tableau/Findings%20Per%20%241M%20in%20Federal%20Spending%20by%20State.png)

![Map - Material Weakness Rate by State](docs/appendix_hubs/methodology/screenshots/tableau/Map%20-%20Material%20Weakness%20Rate%20by%20State.png)

**Risk Tiering**

This visualization shows the relationship between Audit Health Score and federal funding received. Red-tier entities received disproportionately more funding than Green-tier entities with cleaner audit records.
