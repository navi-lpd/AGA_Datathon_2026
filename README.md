# Fiscal Patriots



**AuditsMadeSimple  •  AGA Datathon 2026**




> A public-facing educational platform helping citizens explore federal financial assistance alongside audit oversight signals

## Why This Exists

Federal funding data is large, fragmented, and hard to interpret quickly. Audit data is even harder because it uses specialized terminology and the impact is not always obvious. Our goal is to make these systems approachable without oversimplifying the responsibility required to interpret oversight data.

**This project helps users:**
- Explore funding patterns by geography and time
- Learn audit terminology with plain-language definitions
- Use a screening signal (Audit Health Score) to identify entities that may merit a closer look
- Follow guided examples (case studies and next steps) to investigate responsibly

---

## What We Built

### 1. Interactive Exploration (Tableau)
Dashboards that highlight:
- Funding distribution across states
- Funding trends over time
- Major funding sources by federal agency
- High-risk entities with funding context

### 2. Financial Literacy Glossary
A glossary section translating common audit and spending terms into short, useful explanations — making government accountability language accessible for everyday citizens.

### 3. Dataset Guide
Descriptions of USAspending, FAC, and SAM — what each tracks, what it misses, and how to navigate them for your own research questions.

### 4. Guided Engagement (Case Studies & What's Next)
Short walkthroughs and a checklist-style next steps page that keeps visitors engaged and shows what to do after the first chart.

### 5. Audit Health Score (Screening Signal)
A simple, interpretable 0-100 score designed to help users prioritize where to look deeper — without claiming wrongdoing.

## Integrated Data Sources

We connect official public sources using UEI (Unique Entity Identifier) whenever possible:

| Source | What It Tracks | Coverage |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **USAspending.gov** | Federal spending and award transactions — who received funds, how much, from which agency | 74M records |
| **FAC.gov** | Single Audit submissions for non-federal entities expending $750K+ in federal awards | 57K entities |
| **SAM.gov** | Governmentwide exclusions — debarments, suspensions, and other exclusion actions | 167K records |

---

USAspending transaction-level data was transformed into recipient-level summaries for each fiscal year (2019–2024), then combined to enable year-over-year trend analysis and cumulative funding calculations. Both yearly and all-years outputs were exported to CSV and Tableau Hyper formats for dashboard integration.

## Audit Health Score

A 0-100 screening signal designed for interpretability and responsible prioritization.

### Definition
```
Audit Health Score = 100 − Risk Points (capped to keep score in 0-100 range)
```

### Tiering

| Tier | Score | Interpretation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 🟢 **Green** | 80-100 | Fewer oversight signals — continue standard validation |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | 60-79 | Moderate signals — review patterns year-over-year |
| 🔴 **Red** | 0-59 | Highest oversight signals — prioritize for deeper review |

### Risk Signals (Examples)

**Risk Points increase based on:**
- Severity of findings and internal control issues
- Repeat findings across years
- Questioned costs indicators
- Going concern or modified opinion indicators

**Risk Points decrease based on:**
- Low-risk auditee designation
- Stronger corrective action patterns

> ⚠️ **Important:** This score is a prioritization aid, not a verdict. It does not prove fraud, waste, or abuse.

## Predictive Modeling Prototype

An early prototype exploring whether audit and funding history can help anticipate future risk signals.

- **Goal:** Entity-year prediction (use year t to predict findings in year t+1)
- **Approach:** HistGradientBoosting classification on engineered features
- **Feature families:** Prior findings counts/flags, award volume, funding totals/mix, agency/program diversity
- **Performance:** ROC-AUC 0.7656, PR-AUC 0.5439

*This is a prototype for learning and prioritization, not an operational system.*

4. Convert Risk Points into Audit Health Score and tier labels
5. Merge FAC audit context with USAspending funding context on UEI
6. Export analysis outputs for Tableau and website

**Start with:** `FAC_Master_With_Risk_Score.yxmd` (Alteryx) → `FAC_USAspending_Merged_Detail.csv`

*This project is for educational and public understanding purposes. Audit and exclusion signals require context. The presence of a finding or a higher-risk tier is not proof of wrongdoing. Always validate conclusions with primary documentation, program context, and proper investigative standards.*
